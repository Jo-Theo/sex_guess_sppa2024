Problem : we have a series of in and out by nest, but some time the Sex of the bird is unknown, our goal is to refill that Sex information in the least harming way possible.

We do that using information learned on swaping frequencies, in relation to time in and out, and other environemental variable. 

The goal is to predict the probability for one bird to change state for every unknown occassion and a mechanic filter paired with it that detect.

- test_completion.R is an R code that I wrote that try to combine both Data processing and analysis trough a more mecanical way by counting the number of possibilities in that composition problem. 

- test_hsmm_python.py is an copy pasted code from chatGPT try to resolve the problem trough HSMM solution on python
